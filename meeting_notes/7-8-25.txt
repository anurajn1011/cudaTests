Continuation of the previous meeting. 

Refactored some of the code for ease of use and for cleaning redundancies. 
Created a data_cleaning file to pull out the tickers that fill out every minute of the trading day.
Using the nasdaq dataset was tedious and took some time. We decided on trying to look at subsets of the dataset instead.
We also used AlphaVantage's API to try out their endpoints and we find similar results. 
Perhaps when we have gaps in time between two assets, we can run cointegration tests strictly on the shared time stamps, omitting the times
where one of the assets lacks data.
