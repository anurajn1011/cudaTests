Meeting 7-1-25

Our aim is to accomplish our objective by August 15th. Our goal is to implement a High Frequency Trading model. 

The HFT algorithms we are interested in revolve around statistical-arbitrage or market making. Discussed the notion of HFT's with ETF's,
considering the volatility of these goods (perhaps other metric which we remain as of yet ignorant to?) to measure the trend. 
The idea for the "conglomerate" algorithmic system which had been discussed previously was mentioned again, in so far as being a tool
for risk mitigation for financial portfolios. 

-- Matrix Multiplication via GPU --
Some initial bugs, these were quickly resolved. However, we soon discovered that our kernel was not performing any computational tasks.
We attempted to modify our code, followed debugging principles, and referenced countless forums and documentation hubs, to no avail.
Lastly, asking ChatGPT, the issues was still not resolved and resulted in compilation error. This problem will be followed up on in the next meeting.
